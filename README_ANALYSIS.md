# Analysis addendum

This folder contains the quantitative analysis performed on the CO2/acetone phase-transition concept (Denardin et al., 2013) and system-level calculations for a heat-pump + expander cycle. Files included: PDF report, plots, detailed CSV, JSON summaries and raw analysis outputs.

Key files:
- heat_pump_turbine_analysis.pdf: Full report with figures and tables.
- heat_pump_turbine_analysis.png: Summary plots (net energy vs pressure, mass flow vs pressure).
- heat_pump_turbine_detailed.csv: Full parameter sweep results (per-case).
- heat_pump_turbine_report.json: Summary statistics and best-case scenarios.
- acetone_expansion_energy.json: per-kg expansion energy calculations for acetone cases.
- summary.json: Monte-Carlo sensitivity summary (earlier run).

NOTE: These calculations are model-based and rely on assumptions stated in the PDF and metadata. Experimental validation is required before any build or commercialization.
