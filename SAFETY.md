# SAFETY NOTICE

WARNING: This project involves high-pressure systems (typical operating pressures 70–120 bar) and volatile solvents (e.g., acetone). These materials and operating conditions present significant hazards including overpressure, fire, solvent exposure, and mechanical failure.

Do NOT attempt to build or test any hardware from this repository unless you have:

- Certified pressure-vessel engineering expertise and approvals
- Proper laboratory infrastructure and emergency procedures
- PPE and solvent-handling training
- A formal safety review and documented risk assessment

This repository provides experimental protocols and analysis for research purposes only. Any practical experimentation should be carried out in collaboration with accredited labs and under supervision of qualified engineers.
