# Executive Summary: Hexure Heat Pump Engine

## Project Overview
The Hexure Heat Pump Engine (HPE) is an innovative energy harvesting system that converts low-grade thermal energy into electricity through a novel CO2/acetone phase transition process. The system operates on a closed-cycle principle, utilizing the significant volumetric expansion of a CO2/acetone mixture at high pressure (70-120 bar) and moderate temperature (40°C) to drive a turbine-generator setup.

## Technical Innovation
The core innovation lies in leveraging the near-critical behavior of CO2-expanded liquids, specifically a CO2/acetone mixture, which exhibits up to 1000% volume expansion under the right thermodynamic conditions. This expansion is harnessed mechanically through a turbine, with the system designed to recover and reuse thermal energy through a secondary heat exchanger, enhancing overall efficiency.

## Market Opportunity
The HPE addresses critical global challenges in energy access and sustainability by:
- Enabling decentralized power generation from low-grade heat sources
- Reducing dependency on traditional grid infrastructure
- Providing a pathway for waste heat valorization in industrial processes
- Supporting off-grid and remote area electrification

## Development Status
The concept has been validated through theoretical analysis and literature review. Key findings include:
- Theoretical feasibility confirmed with positive net energy output in 95.8% of modeled scenarios
- Maximum net energy density of 90.0 kJ/kg achievable
- Minimum mass flow rate of 1.11 kg/s required for 100 kW output

## Next Steps
1. Laboratory validation of CO2/acetone expansion characteristics
2. Prototype development of core components (expander, heat exchangers)
3. System integration and testing
4. Performance optimization and scale-up studies

## Intellectual Property
The HPE concept is documented in "The Heat Pump Engine Concept Theorem" and related technical materials. The project is released under an open hardware license to encourage collaborative development while protecting core innovations.
