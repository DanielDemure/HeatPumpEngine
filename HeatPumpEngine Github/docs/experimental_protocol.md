# Experimental Protocol: CO2/Acetone Expansion Validation

## Objective
To experimentally validate the volumetric expansion characteristics of a CO2/acetone mixture under high-pressure, moderate-temperature conditions relevant to the Hexure Heat Pump Engine.

## Equipment Required
1. High-pressure visual cell (capable of 150+ bar operation)
2. Temperature control system (±0.1°C accuracy)
3. Pressure measurement instruments (±0.1 bar accuracy)
4. High-speed camera for phase observation
5. Data acquisition system
6. CO2 and acetone (high purity grades)
7. Mixing chamber and filling system

## Safety Precautions
1. All personnel must be trained in high-pressure system operation
2. Pressure relief systems must be installed and tested
3. Solvent containment measures must be in place
4. Emergency shutdown procedures must be established
5. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times

## Experimental Procedure

### Preparation
1. Inspect all equipment for damage or wear
2. Calibrate all measurement instruments
3. Prepare CO2/acetone mixture in predetermined ratios
4. Evacuate visual cell and check for leaks

### Experiment Execution
1. Fill visual cell with working fluid mixture
2. Set initial temperature (e.g., 20°C)
3. Gradually pressurize to target pressure (e.g., 80 bar)
4. Allow system to stabilize (15-30 minutes)
5. Rapidly depressurize through controlled valve
6. Record high-speed video of expansion process
7. Measure and record final temperature and pressure
8. Repeat for different pressure/temperature combinations

### Data Collection
1. Pressure vs. time during expansion
2. Temperature vs. time during expansion
3. Visual observations of phase changes
4. Volume change measurements from visual cell markings
5. High-speed video footage for detailed analysis

## Analysis Methodology
1. Calculate actual volume expansion ratios
2. Compare with theoretical predictions
3. Characterize phase behavior during expansion
4. Determine energy content of expansion process
5. Assess repeatability and uncertainty

## Expected Outcomes
1. Confirmation of 10x volume expansion under optimal conditions
2. Characterization of phase transitions during expansion
3. Quantification of energy available from expansion
4. Identification of optimal operating parameters
5. Assessment of system feasibility for HPE application
