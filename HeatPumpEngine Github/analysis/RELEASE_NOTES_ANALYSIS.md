HPE Analysis Release — v0.1

This release bundles the thermodynamic and system-level calculations for the CO2/acetone Heat Pump Engine (HPE) concept. Included are: model assumptions, Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis, per-kg PV-work estimates, turbine scenario analyses, and recommended experimental next steps (visual cell + expander tests).

See heat_pump_turbine_analysis.pdf for the full results and methodology.

SAFETY: High pressures (70-120 bar) and volatile solvents are involved. Do NOT attempt construction without certified pressure-system engineers. See SAFETY.md in the repo.
