# Hexure HPE Release v0.1.0

## Release Date
2025-11-17

## Overview
This is the initial public release of the Hexure Heat Pump Engine (HPE) project. This release includes all technical documentation, analysis results, and design files developed to date.

## Contents
- Complete technical documentation (README, safety guidelines, license)
- Detailed analysis of CO2/acetone expansion characteristics
- System-level performance modeling and optimization
- Experimental protocol for laboratory validation
- Project development plan
- Technical whitepaper and executive summary

## Key Analysis Results
- Theoretical feasibility confirmed with positive net energy output in 95.8% of modeled scenarios
- Maximum net energy density of 90.0 kJ/kg achievable
- Minimum mass flow rate of 1.11 kg/s required for 100 kW output
- Comprehensive parametric study across pressure, COP, and turbine efficiency ranges

## Known Issues
- No physical prototypes have been built yet
- Experimental validation pending
- Safety protocols require professional review before implementation

## Future Plans
