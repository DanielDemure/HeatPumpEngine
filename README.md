### Hexure — Heat Pump Engine (HPE)

**WARNING:** High pressures (70–120 bar) and volatile solvents involved — do NOT attempt construction without certified pressure‑system engineers. See SAFETY.md.

### TL;DR
HPE is an open‑source research project exploring a method to convert low‑grade heat (e.g., solar thermal or industrial waste heat) into electricity using a CO2/acetone mixture that exhibits large volumetric expansion under pressure. This repository contains analysis, experimental protocols, design files, datasets, and safety guidance for reproducible research.

### Why open source?
This project is released openly because transparency accelerates technical validation, improves safety through community review, and enables collaborative development of robust, practical solutions.

### What you’ll find here
- `docs/` — executive summary, technical whitepaper, project plan, experimental protocol  
- `analysis/` — datasets, plots, and the analysis report (PDF)  
- `designs/` — sketches and CAD placeholders  
- `prototypes/` — prototype documents and test data  
- `SAFETY.md` — read this first — do not attempt experiments without certified facilities  
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — guidelines for contributions

### Status
Modeling and analysis are complete. Experimental validation and prototype testing are planned. See `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for details.

### Want to help?
1. Read `SAFETY.md` before doing anything.  
2. For data/experimental results: open an issue and tag it `experimental-result`.  
3. For code or doc contributions: fork, create a feature branch, and submit a PR with reproducible data and test details.
